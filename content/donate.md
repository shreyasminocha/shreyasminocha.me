Hey.

Find my work useful? I'm glad! Drop me a line ðŸ˜Š.

If you can afford to, I'd be grateful if you would send a few bucks my way. I publish most of my work under permissive open source licenses like the MIT license, GPL, or those of the Creative Commons breed. I don't believe in ads, tracking and annoyances. I also don't monetize most of my open source work. As I prepare to attend college however, I must start thinking about revenue too. Don't worry thoughâ€”I'll stay loyal to my principles.

Your donations will probably:

- â€¦ pay for a serving of a beverage.
- â€¦Â pay for this domain, my server(s), and other tools.
- â€¦ allow me to continue spending substantial amounts of time on open source.
- â€¦ allow me to continue prioritizing my passions.
- â€¦ pay for my education.
