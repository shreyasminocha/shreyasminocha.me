Hey.

Find my work useful? I'm glad!

If you can afford it, I'd appreciate your monetary support. I publish most of my work under permissive, open source licenses like the MIT license, GPL, or those of the Creative Commons breed. I don't believe in ads, tracking and annoyances. I also don't monetize most of my open source work yet. As I prepare to attend college however, I must start thinking about revenue too. Don't worry though—I'll stay loyal to my principles.

Your donations will probably:

- … pay for a serving of a beverage.
- … pay for this domain, my server(s), and other tools.
- … allow me to continue spending substantial amounts of time on open source.
- … allow me to continue prioritizing my passions.
