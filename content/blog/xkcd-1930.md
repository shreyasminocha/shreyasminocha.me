I really love [xkcd](//xkcd.com). Randall has an amazing sense of humour, even if a tad bit geeky.

The moment I saw this comic, it struck me: "I've to write a program for this!" I decided to make this a command line utility.

> Programming languages are like tools in a mechanic's tool box. Each has its own perks and each is suited to solving a different kind of problem.

Initially I decided to go with [shell](//wikiwand.com/en/Shell_script) for this one.

Clearly, the sentences that can be formed by following the flowchart have the format "Did you know that **[event]** **[unusual way]** because of **[reason]**? Apparently **[wild card statement]**". So we make four arrays with strings as. For example:

```js
"the (fall|spring) equinox",
"the (winter|summer) (solstice|Olympics)",
"the (earliest|latest) (sunrise|sunset)",
"daylight (saving|savings) time",
"leap (day|year)",
"Easter",
"the (harvest|super|blood) moon",
"Toyota truck month",
"shark week"
```

Each of the sub-choices would have the form `(choice|choice|choice)`. There are also some complex cases in the comic such as `drifts out of sync with the (sun|moon|zodiac|(Gregorian|Mayan|lunar|iPhone) calendar|atomic clock in Colorado)`. We will have to deal with nested parentheses as well. I was pretty stuck up on using this approach because it avoids the redundancy of hard coding each of the sub-choices as follows

```js
"the fall equinox",
"the spring equinox",
"the winter solstice",
"the winter Olympics",
"the summer solstice",
"the summer Olympics",
// ...
```

...and because it is intuitive(especially if you're familiar with [regular expressions, aka 'regex'](//wikiwand.com/en/Regular_expression)).

Before working out a regular expression to extract the choices from the parentheses, I did some research as to how I would be able to use the regex with shell script. I found a similar [stackoverflow question](//stackoverflow.com/questions/31123641/how-to-find-and-extract-all-words-appearing-between-brackets)(which didn't even raise the nested brackets issue) but the answers and comments either gave complicated ways to solve the problem or suggested the use of another language. So I switched to javascript(nodejs).

Initially, I made an attempt to write a regular expression to match the outermost parentheses. For example, in `drifts out of sync with the (sun|moon|zodiac|(Gregorian|Mayan|lunar|iPhone) calendar|atomic clock in Colorado)`, I would attempt to match `(sun|moon|zodiac|(Gregorian|Mayan|lunar|iPhone) calendar|atomic clock in Colorado)`. This proved to be challenging. I couldn't get my regular expression to ensure that inner parentheses are matched. For example, I could get it to match only `(sun|moon|zodiac|(Gregorian|Mayan|lunar|iPhone)` in our example. I was close to giving up on the regex idea altogether when a different approach struck me while playing around on [regexr](//regexr.com). Rather than attempting to match the parentheses outside-in, I would match it inside-out. Matching the innermost choice first, replacing the entire parentheses with a random choice within it.

So now we need to figure out how to extract the choices between the parentheses, split them by the '\|' delimiter, choose one of the strings from the resulting array and replace the matched portion with the chosen string. All this while ensuring that it works with nested parentheses. I opened a [regex playground](//regexr.com) and started experimenting. Eventually, I came up with `\(([\w\-|\'\ \d]+?)\)`. I highly recommend that you play around with this regular expression in this [demo](//regexr.com/3iii6), especially if you aren't familiar with the regex syntax.  Pay attention to the [capture groups there](//regexone.com/lesson/capturing_groups), we'll use them soon.

We now have to write  `simplify(string) ` which would accept  `drifts out of sync with the (sun|moon|zodiac|(Gregorian|Mayan|lunar|iPhone) calendar|atomic clock in Colorado)`, for instance, and would return `drifts out of sync with the sun`.

```js
/**
 * Simplifies a string resolving brackets inside-out
 * @param  {String} string string to be simplified
 * @return {String}        simplified string
 */
function simplify(string) {}
```

Have a look at [the documentation for javascript's `string.replace`](//devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/string/replace). Go through the entire page but pay special attention to the 'Specifying a function as a parameter' section. Optionally, check out [`string.match`](//devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/string/match) too. We will know resolve each choice till the regex no longer matches the passed string using `string.replace(regex, func)`. Let's first try writing the replacement function(the one that we will pass as a parameter to `string.replace`). We assume that we have a `randomElement(array)` function already defined.

```js
function replacer(match, choices) {
    return randomElement(choices.split("|"));
}
```

The replace function will pass the `match` and `choices` parameters(you must know what these are if you went through the `string.replace` documentation I referred to earlier). We split the `choices` capture group, by the `|` delimiter, into an array and return a random element of the same.

Here's the final `simplify` function. We convert the `replacer` function we wrote earlier into an [ES6](//ponyfoo.com/articles/es6) style [arrow function](//devdocs.io/javascript/functions/arrow_functions).

```Js
function simplify(string) {
    const remainingChoices = /\(([a-zA-Z\d'\| \-]+?)\)/g;

    while (string.match(remainingChoices)) {
        string = string.replace(remainingChoices, (match, choices) =>
            randomElement(choices.split("|"))
        );
    }

    return string;
}
```

If you aren't familiar with the `const` keyword, have a look at [this article](//blog.isomr.co/ecmascript-6-lets-see-what-it-has-to-offer) about ES6 for an overview of some of the most important ES6 features.

With this function done, the rest of the program is trivial. Feel free to have a shot at it. Earlier in this article, I had mentioned writing this as a command line utility. The details of writing a [command line utility in javascript](//www.sitepoint.com/javascript-command-line-interface-cli-node-js) are outside the scope of this article. You can poke around with the entire source code for this program on [Github](//github.com/shreyasminocha/calendar-facts).
