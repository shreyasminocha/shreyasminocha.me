As you might be aware, [git supports global `gitignore` files](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/gitinfoexclude), allowing us to define ignore patterns for files across system.

The global gitignore is best reserved for patterns for things like:

- OS-specific junk (`.DS_Store`, ‚Ä¶)
- editor-specific stuff (`.vscode`, `.sublime-workspace`, ‚Ä¶)
- personal notes etc (e.g. `.todo`, `.notes/`, ‚Ä¶)

Everyone needs different combinations of these‚Äîrepositories' local `.gitignore`s shouldn't be cluttered with these.

The local `.gitignore` should, instead, hold project-specific patterns. These may be related to your dependency management tools, frameworks, coverage checking tools, the rest.

This isn't an original thought by any means, but it's a big pet-peeve üê∂.
