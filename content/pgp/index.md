I use other keys for personal email addresses. If I communicate with you using one of those, please ask for the respective public key. I'll sign it with one of these keys on request.

If someone claiming to be me contacts you, you may ask them to verify their identity by signing a message using one of these keys. I would typically gladly oblige.
