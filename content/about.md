Hey, I'm Shreyas (/ˈʃreɪˌəs/ or shr-AY-us). I'm a junior at Rice University and plan to major in le CS.

I feel strongly about [software freedom](https://www.fsf.org/about), [digital privacy](https://ssd.eff.org), and [decentralization](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse). I detest [surveillance capitalism](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/02/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism) and believe in [consumer rights](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/). I value [digital accessibility](https://www.a11yproject.com) and enjoy digital design. I also take an interest in digital archiving.

At present, I am primarily interested in the {modern,retro,alt} web stack. I'm also interested in exploring computer ethics, programming language design, automata theory, and cryptography.

This is my website. I have [a blog](/blog) here where I post programming-related articles less frequently than I'd like. I also have a [wiki](https://wiki.shreyasminocha.me) where I try to make notes about stuff I'm learning, among other things.
