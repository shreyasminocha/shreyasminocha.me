Hey, I'm Shreyas (/ˈʃreɪˌəs/ or shr-AY-us). I'm a freshman at Rice University and plan to major in le CS.

I feel strongly about [software freedom](https://www.fsf.org/about), [digital privacy](https://ssd.eff.org), and [decentralization](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse). I detest [surveillance capitalism](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/02/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism) and ["big tech"](https://gafam.info). I value [digital accessibility](https://www.a11yproject.com) and have something of an eye for design.

An old copy of _Learn HTML in 24 Hours_ drew me into computer things several years ago 💻. At present, I am primarily interested in the {modern,retro,alt} web stack. I'm also interested in exploring computer ethics 🛑, programming language design 👨🏽‍💻, automata theory 🤖, and cryptography 🔐. My interests will probably evolve, as they should, in my time at college.

My preferred code editor at the moment is [VS&nbsp;Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) ([VS&nbsp;Codium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), actually).

This is my website. I have [a blog](/blog) here where I post programming-related articles less frequently than I'd like. I also have a [wiki](https://wiki.shreyasminocha.me) where I try to make notes about stuff I'm learning, among other things.

## Silly trivia about me

- I love parenthetical clauses (but I'm afraid I overuse them).
- I prefer dark themes over light ones, but I'm not one to [bikeshed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding). I've been a long-time user of material themes (like [this one for VS&nbsp;Code](https://material-theme.site)) for editors and terminals.

That's enough about me. I would love to hear from you! If there is anything you thnk I could help you with, a cool project you would like to collab on, or if you'd like to just chat, [hit me up](/contact).
