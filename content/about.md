Hey, I'm Shreyas (/ËˆÊƒreÉªËŒÉ™s/ or shr-AY-us). I'm a sophomore at Rice University and plan to major in le CS.

I feel strongly about [software freedom](https://www.fsf.org/about), [digital privacy](https://ssd.eff.org), and [decentralization](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse). I detest [surveillance capitalism](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/02/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism) and believe in [consumer rights](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/). I value [digital accessibility](https://www.a11yproject.com) and have something of an eye for design. I also take an interest in digital archiving.

An old copy of _Learn HTML in 24 Hours_ drew me into computer things several years ago ðŸ’». At present, I am primarily interested in the {modern,retro,alt} web stack. I'm also interested in exploring computer ethics, programming language design, automata theory, and cryptography. My interests will probably evolve, as they should, in my time at college.

This is my website. I have [a blog](/blog) here where I post programming-related articles less frequently than I'd like. I also have a [wiki](https://wiki.shreyasminocha.me) where I try to make notes about stuff I'm learning, among other things.

That's enough about me. I would love to hear from you! If there is anything you thnk I could help you with, a cool project you would like to collab on, or if you'd like to just chat, [hit me up](/contact).
