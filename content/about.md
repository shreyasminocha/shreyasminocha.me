Hey, I'm Shreyas, from India. I love code and mathematics. I enjoy contributing to the [open source software](https://www.github.com/shreyasminocha). I am 15 years old and am studying in an [amazing school](http://www.doonschool.com) here in Dehradun. I started learning programming at the age of 10 when I found a really old book about HTML. Since then, I am familiar with modern web technologies as well as C++ and Java(to some extent). I am a great fan of the [xkcd](http://www.xkcd.com) web comic. My favourite code editor is [atom](http://atom.io).

As a 10th grader, I am busy with my ICSE board studies and code purely out of passion and in my free time. I plan to pursue a career in the field of computers out of the passion I have grown for it. Additionally, I love anything that challenges the mind(partly why I enjoy math and physics).

This is my website, I have a blog here where I post tutorials and articles about all things computers and math. [Check it out!](https://shreyasminocha.me/blog)

That's enough about me. I would love to hear from you! If there is anything you would like help with, a cool project you would like to work with me on, or if you'd like to just chat, please drop me a line at [shreyas@shreyasminocha.me](mailto:shreyas@shreyasminocha.me).
