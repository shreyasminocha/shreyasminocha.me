Hey, I'm Shreyas, from India. I love code and mathematics. I enjoy contributing to the [open source software](https://www.github.com/shreyasminocha). I am 15 years old and am studying in an [amazing school](http://www.doonschool.com) here in Dehradun. I started programming at the age of 10 when I found a book from the 1990s about HTML. Since then, I have grown fond of the world of technology, especially web technologies with a soft spot for Javascript. Node.js is something I have grown considerable interest in and am self learning the brilliant technology. I am fond of [xkcd](http://www.xkcd.com)-like humour. My favourite code editor is [atom](http://atom.io) and my shell of choice is zsh.

As a 9th grader, I am busy with my ICSE board studies and code purely out of passion and in my free time. I do however plan to pursue a career in this very field out of the love I have grown for computers. Additionally, I love challenges(partly why I love math and physics).

This is my website, I have a blog here where I post tutorials and articles about all things computers and math. I plan to also post general(non-tech) stuff in the future. [Check it out](https://shreyasminocha.me/blog).

That's enough about me. I would love to hear from you! If there is anything you would like help with, a cool project you would like to work with me on, or if you'd like to just chat, please drop me a line at [shreyas@shreyasminocha.me](mailto:shreyas@shreyasminocha.me).
