Hey, I'm Shreyas, from India. I love code and mathematics. I enjoy contributing to the [open source software](//www.github.com/shreyasminocha). I started learning programming at the age of 10 when I found a really old book about HTML and from there I spiralled into the wonderful world of CS. I am familiar with modern web technologies as well as C++ and Java(to some extent). I am a great fan of the [xkcd](//www.xkcd.com) web comic. My preferred code editor at the moment is [VS Code](//code.visualstudio.com/).

This is my website. I have a blog here where I post tutorials and articles about all things tech. [Check it out!](/blog)

That's enough about me. I would love to hear from you! If there is anything you would like help with, a cool project you would like to work with me on, or if you'd like to just chat, please drop me a line at [shreyas@shreyasminocha.me](mailto:shreyas@shreyasminocha.me).
