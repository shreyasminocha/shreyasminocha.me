Hey, I'm Shreyas. I recently graduated high school and will head to university soon.

I have strong feelings about software freedom, digital privacy, and decentralization. I detest surveillance capitalism and "big tech". I value digital accessibility and have something of an eye for design.

An old copy of _Learn HTML in 24 Hours_ was my gateway drug into computer things ðŸ’». At present, I am primarily interested in the modern web stack. I'm also interested in exploring computer ethics and programming language design. My interests will probably evolve, as they should, in my time at college.

My preferred code editor at the moment is [VS&nbsp;Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) ([VS&nbsp;Codium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), actually).

This is my website. I have [a blog](/blog) here where I post programming-related articles less frequently than I'd like. I also have a [wiki](//wiki.shreyasminocha.me) where I try to make notes about stuff I'm learning, among other things.

## Silly trivia about me

- I was born just a few months after the `9/11` tragedy.
- I love parenthetical clauses (but I'm afraid I overuse them).
- I prefer dark themes over light ones, but I'm not one to [bikeshed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding). I've been a long-time user of material themes (like [this one for VS&nbsp;Code](https://material-theme.site)) for editors and terminals.

That's enough about me. I would love to hear from you! If there is anything you thnk I could help you with, a cool project you would like to collab on, or if you'd like to just chat, [hit me up](/contact).
