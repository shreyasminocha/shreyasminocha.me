Hey, I'm Shreyas, from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. I am, currently, a high school senior studying ISC sciences, particularly Physics, Chemistry, Math, and ~~Computer Science~~ "Computer Studies" in addition to English.

I believe software should come with [freedoms](//www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). This makes for software that's more trustworthy, often of greater quality, and contributes to a collection of free (as in "freedom") software. I release most of [my software projects](//github.com/shreyasminocha) and other work under permissive licenses.

At any given moment, you _may_ or _may not_ find me ranting about the evils of surveillance capitalism and the importance of online privacy. But on a serious note, online privacy is a grave matter. It's disheartening how so many people turn a blind eye to these matters. Glenn Greenwald does a good job of making a case for online privacy in [his TED talk, 'Why Privacy Matters'](//www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters). As a next step, check out [PrivacyTools.io](//privacytools.io). If you ask some of my friends, they may call me paranoid, but I understand the value of trade-offsâ€”it's just that I put myself further towards the left end of the _Privacy-Convenience spectrum_ than most.

I started learning "programming" at 10 years of age when I found a really old copy of _Learn HTML in 24 Hours_ lying around and from there I spiralled into the wonderful world of CS. At present, I am primarily interested in modern web technologies and [Node.js](//nodejs.org/en). I'm also interested in exploring computer ethics and programming language design. My interests will probably evolve (as they should), in my time at college. I have an eye for design too. I obsess (but not the point of impracticality) over the notions of "clean code" and enjoy books about software engineering best practices like [_The Pragmatic Programmer_](//pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition) by Hunt & Thomas, [_Clean Code_](//www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Bob Martin, and [_Base Code_](//www.basecodefieldguide.com/) by Jason McCreary.

I am a great fan of the [xkcd](//xkcd.com) web comic, like almost everyone in the developer community. My preferred code editor at the moment is [VS&nbsp;Code](//code.visualstudio.com) (actually [VS Codium](//github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), if I'm being pedantic).

This is my website. I have [a blog](/blog) here where I post tutorials and articles about all things tech, although I should really work on my post frequency. [Check it out!](/blog). I also have a [MediaWiki instance](//wiki.shreyasminocha.me) where I usually make notes about stuff I'm learning, among other things.

## Stupid trivia about me

- I was born just a few months after the `9/11` tragedy.
- I'm unsure of my sun sign. It's either Scorpio, or Sagittarius. Different astrologers assign different signs to my birth date. Just to be clear, I don't actually believe in horoscopes.
- My skin colour is approximately [`hsl(24, 23%, 63%)`](//www.colorhexa.com/b69c8b) (or [`#b59b8a`](//www.colorhexa.com/b69c8b) if you prefer).
- I love parenthetical clauses (but I'm afraid I overuse them).
- I prefer dark themes over light ones, but I'm not one to [bikeshed](//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding). I've been a long-time user of material themes (like [this one for VS&nbsp;Code](//material-theme.site)) for editors and terminals.

That's enough about me. I would love to hear from you! If there is anything you thnk I could help you with, a cool project you would like to collab on, or if you'd like to just chat, please drop me a line at `shreyas` [at the rate of] `shreyasminocha.me`. If you're familiar with [PGP](//emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en), my public key is [`79E1D3DC`](/pgp/@shreyasminocha.me.pub).
