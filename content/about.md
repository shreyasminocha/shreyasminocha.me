Hey, I'm Shreyas, from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. I recently graduated high school and will head to university soon.

I believe software should come with [freedoms](//www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). This makes for software that's more trustworthy, often of greater quality, and contributes to a collection of free (as in "freedom") software. I release most of [my software projects](//github.com/shreyasminocha) and other work under permissive licenses.

You _may_  find me ranting about the evils of surveillance capitalism and the importance of online privacy. It's disheartening how so many people turn a blind eye to these matters. Glenn Greenwald does a good job of making a case for online privacy in [his TED talk, 'Why Privacy Matters'](//www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters). As a next step, check out [PrivacyTools.io](//privacytools.io). Some may call me paranoid, but I understand the value of trade-offsâ€”it's just that I put myself further towards the left end of the _Privacy-Convenience spectrum_ than most.

I started learning "programming" at 10 years of age when I found a really old copy of _Learn HTML in 24 Hours_ lying around and from there I spiralled into the wonderful world of CS. At present, I am primarily interested in modern web technologies and [Node.js](//nodejs.org/en). I'm also interested in exploring computer ethics and programming language design. My interests will probably evolve (as they should), in my time at college. I have an eye for design too.

My preferred code editor at the moment is [VS&nbsp;Code](//code.visualstudio.com) ([VS&nbsp;Codium](//github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), actually).

This is my website. I have [a blog](/blog) here where I post tutorials and articles about all things tech, although I should really work on my post frequency. [Check it out!](/blog). I also have a [GitBook instance](//wiki.shreyasminocha.me) where I try to make notes about stuff I'm learning, among other things.

## Stupid trivia about me

- I was born just a few months after the `9/11` tragedy.
- I love parenthetical clauses (but I'm afraid I overuse them).
- I prefer dark themes over light ones, but I'm not one to [bikeshed](//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding). I've been a long-time user of material themes (like [this one for VS&nbsp;Code](//material-theme.site)) for editors and terminals.

That's enough about me. I would love to hear from you! If there is anything you thnk I could help you with, a cool project you would like to collab on, or if you'd like to just chat, please drop me a line at `shreyas` [at the rate of] `shreyasminocha.me`. If you're familiar with [PGP](//emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en), my public key is [`79E1D3DC`](/pgp/@shreyasminocha.me.pub).
