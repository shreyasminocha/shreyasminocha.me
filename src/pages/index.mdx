I graduated from Rice&nbsp;University in May 2024 with a Computer&nbsp;Science major and a Math minor. My research interests include applied cryptography, systems security, and software security. I'm especially interested in privacy-enhancing technologies.

In the past, I've been fortunate to work with [Dr&nbsp;Marcel&nbsp;BÃ¶hme](https://mboehme.github.io/) at [MPI-SP](https://www.mpi-sp.org/), as well as [Dr&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Wallach](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/) and [Dr&nbsp;Nathan&nbsp;Dautenhahn](https://nathandautenhahn.com/) at Rice.

Causes that are important to me include software freedom, digital privacy and anonymity, freedom of speech, consumer rights, and [data preservation](https://archive.org/details/@eabf4fdb0f7a).

I also enjoy [speedcubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2022MINO03), playing chess, and participating in CTFs with [RiceSec](https://sec.rice.edu).
