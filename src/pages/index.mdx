I'm a second-year PhD student at the Georgia&nbsp;Tech [School&nbsp;of Cybersecurity and Privacy](https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/), where I'm working with [Dr&nbsp;Mike&nbsp;Specter](https://mikespecter.com/). My research interests include applied cryptography, systems security, and software security. I'm especially interested in privacy-enhancing technologies and other aspects of computer security relevant to public policy.

I graduated from Rice&nbsp;University in May 2024 as a Computer&nbsp;Science major. In the past, I've been fortunate to work with [Dr&nbsp;Marcel&nbsp;BÃ¶hme](https://mboehme.github.io/) at [MPI-SP](https://www.mpi-sp.org/), as well as [Dr&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;Wallach](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/) at Rice.

I care deeply about software freedom, digital privacy and anonymity, freedom of speech, consumer rights, and data preservation.

I also enjoy [speedcubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2022MINO03), participating in CTFs, playing [chess](https://lichess.org/@/acute-triangle), learning languages, [collecting coins](https://en.numista.com/vous/vos_pieces.php?user=417600), and [contributing](https://archive.org/details/@eabf4fdb0f7a) [to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ShreyasMinocha) [the](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0) [commons](https://musicbrainz.org/user/shreyasminocha).
Sometimes, I [read books](https://openlibrary.org/people/eabf4fdb0f7a/books/currently-reading).
