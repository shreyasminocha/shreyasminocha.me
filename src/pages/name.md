It's **Shreyas Minocha**. That's pronounced [shr-AY-us min-o-cha](/name.flac) (_cha_ as in _chai_ or _ch_ as in _channel_). In IPA, I believe that's [/ʃrˈeɪəs ˌmɪnoˈtʃä/](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CA%83r%CB%88e%C9%AA%C9%99s%20%CB%8Cm%C9%AAno%CB%88t%CA%83%C3%A4&voice=Aditi).

In Devanagari, it's श्रेयस मिनोचा and in Nastaliq, I believe it's شْرییَسَ مِنوچَا. If you can read those, you probably already knew how to pronounce the name.

I also have the Chinese name 学呀 (it was previously 雪鸭子).
