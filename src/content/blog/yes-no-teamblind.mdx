A [recent Atlanta speedcubing competition](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/GACubersPBQ2025) had an interesting unofficial event: "Yes/No Teamblind".
The idea is that partcipants compete in pairs, where one person wears a blindfolds throughout the solve and asks questions, while the other can say only <Signal signal="Y" longVersion /> or <Signal signal="N" longVersion />.

> Yes/No TeamBLD: Like standard TeamBLD, competitors will sign up in pairs.
> Each pair will do two attempts, switching roles inbetween.
> Rankings will be determined by the best of the two attempts.
> Unlike standard TeamBLD, the sighted competitor can only say "yes" and "no".
> The blindfolded competitor should gain information primarily by asking yes/no questions.
> However, the sighted competitor may speak outside of answering questions, as long as they do not say anything other than "yes" or "no".

My friend [Joon](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2012CHAJ01) and I decided to compete together and came up with a method we're fairly happy with.
With a few days of practice, we were able to achieve an Ao12 of **1:06.64**, an Ao5 of **1:01.31**, and a best single of **53.76** with Joon as the oracle.

This description of our method assumes that you are broadly familiar with methods for speedsolving 3x3 cubes ([CFOP](https://jperm.net/3x3/cfop) in particular).

## Cross and First Two Layers (F2L)

We solve the cross and the first two layers in a pretty straightforward manner: the oracle dictates encoded moves from an initial orientation of their choice.
We picked a subset of moves to use, balancing the complexity of signal memorization and "constraindness".

Our final set is R (with R2 and R'), U (with U2 and U'), y, y', F, and D.
Since R-moves and U-moves are the most "useful" of the lot, we give them the most convenient signals.

-   R-moves: <Signal signal="Y" />, <Signal signal="YY" />, and <Signal signal="YYY" /> for R, R2, and R' respectively
-   U-moves: <Signal signal="N" />, <Signal signal="NN" />, and <Signal signal="NNN" /> for U, U2, and U' respectively
-   Rotations: <Signal signal="YN" /> for y and <Signal signal="NY" /> for y'
-   F: <Signal signal="YNY" />
-   D: <Signal signal="NYN" />

Once F2L is complete, the oracle signals <Signal signal="YYYYY" longVersion />, indicating the transition to the last layer.

## Orient Last Layer (OLL)

We perform OLL in two steps: edges followed by corners.
While we're both familiar with most, if not all, one-look OLL cases, 57 is too many cases to try to encode efficiently.

### OLL Edges

The oracle describes the orientation of the edges in top/right/bottom/left order, with a <Signal signal="N" longVersion /> for an unoriented edge and a <Signal signal="Y" longVersion /> for an oriented edge.

<FigureGroup>
    <LastLayerFigure alg="U2 f R U R' U' f'" experimental-stickering="OLL">
        <Signal signal="YNNY" longVersion slot="caption" />
    </LastLayerFigure>
    <LastLayerFigure
        alg="F R U R' U' F' f R U R' U' f'"
        experimental-stickering="OLL"
    >
        <Signal signal="NNNN" longVersion slot="caption" />
    </LastLayerFigure>
</FigureGroup>

### OLL Corners

Similar to the edges, the oracle describes the orientation of the corners in clockwise order starting with the top-left corner.
Here, there are four non-trivial cases:

-   Plus: H or Pi

    The executor typically asks "H?".
    If it is H-case, they can ask something like "these two?" to determine how to perform the OLL.
    If it's not an H-case, they ask about where the Pi bar is e.g. "these two?" followed by "AUF (to get the bar there)?".

        <LastLayerFigure
            alg="R U2 R' U' R U R' U' R U' R'"
            experimental-stickering="OLL"

            <Signal signal="NNNN" longVersion slot="caption" />
        </LastLayerFigure>
        <LastLayerFigure

            <Signal signal="NNNN" longVersion slot="caption" />
        </LastLayerFigure>
        <LastLayerFigure
            alg="U' f R U R' U' f' F R U R' U' F'"

        >
            <Signal signal="NNNN" longVersion slot="caption" />
        </LastLayerFigure>
    </FigureGroup>

-   Fish: sune or anti-sune

    This can be disambiguated with a "Sune?".

    <FigureGroup>
        <LastLayerFigure alg="R U R' U R U2 R'" experimental-stickering="OLL">
            <Signal signal="NNNY" longVersion slot="caption" />
        </LastLayerFigure>
        <LastLayerFigure
            alg="U R' U' R U' R' U2 R"
            experimental-stickering="OLL"
        >
            <Signal signal="NNNY" longVersion slot="caption" />
        </LastLayerFigure>
    </FigureGroup>

-   L: two ways the unsolved corners could be twisted

    Asking "this one?" while pointing to a facelet of one of the unoriented corners is implicitly asking whether that facelet is the same colour as the upper layer.
    One question is enough to disambiguate the subcase.

    <FigureGroup>
        <LastLayerFigure
            alg="F' r U R' U' r' F R"
            experimental-stickering="OLL"
        >
            <Signal signal="NYNY" longVersion slot="caption" />
        </LastLayerFigure>
        <LastLayerFigure
            alg="U2 F' r U R' U' r' F R"
            experimental-stickering="OLL"
        >
            <Signal signal="NYNY" longVersion slot="caption" />
        </LastLayerFigure>
    </FigureGroup>

-   Shooter: T or U

    Similarly, here the executor can ask either "these two?" or "T?" or "U?".
    Again, one question is enough.

    <FigureGroup>
        <LastLayerFigure
            alg="U r U R' U' r' F R F'"
            experimental-stickering="OLL"
        >
            <Signal signal="YYNN" longVersion slot="caption" />
        </LastLayerFigure>
        <LastLayerFigure
            alg="R2 D R' U2 R D' R' U2 R'"
            experimental-stickering="OLL"
        >
            <Signal signal="YYNN" longVersion slot="caption" />
        </LastLayerFigure>
    </FigureGroup>

## Permute Last Layer (PLL)

For PLL, we went with 2-look PLL because we figured signalling the 2 PLL steps would be significantly quicker than signalling the exact PLL.

### PLL Corners

We split PLL corners into two (plus one) cases:

-   Adjacent Corner Swap (Bar)
-   Diagonal Corner Swap (No Bar)
-   Solved

For the bar case, the oracle describes the corners in the standard order with a <Signal signal="Y" longVersion /> for a corner that's a part of the bar, and a <Signal signal="N" longVersion /> for one that isn't.
The executor then knows how to align the upper face to solve the edges with a **T-perm**.

<FigureGroup>
    <LastLayerFigure
        alg="R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'"
        experimental-stickering="PLL"
    >
        <Signal signal="YNNY" longVersion slot="caption" />
    </LastLayerFigure>
    <LastLayerFigure
        alg="U' R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'"
        experimental-stickering="PLL"
    >
        <Signal signal="YYNN" longVersion slot="caption" />
    </LastLayerFigure>
    <LastLayerFigure
        alg="U R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'"
        experimental-stickering="PLL"
    >
        <Signal signal="NNYY" longVersion slot="caption" />
    </LastLayerFigure>
</FigureGroup>

For the 'no bar' case, the oracle says either <Signal signal="YNYN" /> or the equivalent <Signal signal="NYNY" />.
This case can be solved with a **Y-perm** from any angle.

<FigureGroup>
    <LastLayerFigure
        alg="U' F R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R F'"
        experimental-stickering="PLL"
    >
        <Fragment slot="caption">
            <Signal signal="YNYN" /> or <Signal signal="NYNY" />
        </Fragment>
    </LastLayerFigure>
    <LastLayerFigure
        alg="U x' (L' U L) D' (L' U' L) D (L' U' L) D' (L' U L) D x"
        experimental-stickering="PLL"
    >
        <Fragment slot="caption">
            <Signal signal="YNYN" /> or <Signal signal="NYNY" />
        </Fragment>
    </LastLayerFigure>
    <LastLayerFigure
        alg="R' (U R U' R') F' U' F (R U R') (F R' F' R) U' R"
        experimental-stickering="PLL"
    >
        <Fragment slot="caption">
            <Signal signal="YNYN" /> or <Signal signal="NYNY" />
        </Fragment>
    </LastLayerFigure>
</FigureGroup>

When the corners are already permuted, the oracle says <Signal signal="YYYY" />.

### PLL Edges

There are three non-trivial standard cases for PLL edges:

-   Ua- or Ub-perm (three unsolved edges)
-   H-perm (four unsolved edges)
-   Z-perm (four unsolved edges)
-   Solved

For U-perm cases, the oracle says <Signal signal="Y" longVersion /> for a solved edge and <Signal signal="N" longVersion /> for an unsolved edge.
The excecutor follows up with "Clockwise?", which the oracle simply answers with <Signal signal="Y" longVersion /> (for the Ub case) or <Signal signal="N" longVersion /> (for the Ua case).

The H-perm is either <Signal signal="YNYN" /> or the equivalent <Signal signal="NYNY" />.

Finally, the Z-perm case is either:

-   <Signal signal="YNNY" /> or <Signal signal="NYYN" /> when the right and
    bottom edges are being swapped
-   <Signal signal="YYNN" /> or <Signal signal="NNYY" /> when the top and right
    edges are being swapped

<FigureGroup>
    <LastLayerFigure
        alg="M2 U M2 U M' U2 M2 U2 M'"
        experimental-stickering="PLL"
    >
        <Fragment slot="caption">
            <Signal signal="YNNY" /> or <Signal signal="NYYN" />
        </Fragment>
    </LastLayerFigure>
    <LastLayerFigure
        alg="U M2 U M2 U M' U2 M2 U2 M'"
        experimental-stickering="PLL"
    >
        <Fragment slot="caption">
            <Signal signal="YYNN" /> or <Signal signal="NNYY" />
        </Fragment>
    </LastLayerFigure>
</FigureGroup>

The intuition here is that we signal edges that are being swapped with the same symbol (either <Signal signal="Y" longVersion /> or <Signal signal="N" longVersion />).

## Align Upper Face (AUF)

For AUF, the oracle simply signals the move required to complete the solve.
When an AUF is necessary, this is either <Signal signal="N" longVersion />, <Signal signal="NN" longVersion />, or <Signal signal="NNN" longVersion />.
When an AUF is not necessary, the oracle says <Signal signal="YYYYY…" longVersion />, signalling that the cube is solved.

## Special Cases

Since the overhead of fully explaining large skips that result in a solved cube is too high, we handle them differently.
For a PLL skip, or the rare LL skip, the oracle indicates the AUF move (if necessary) immediately followed by a stream of Yes's e.g. <Signal signal="NNYYY…" longVersion />.
Failing that, they may just jump straight to <Signal signal="YYYYY…" longVersion /> (incurring an acceptable two-second penalty).

Our signal for handling "exceptions", especially after F2L, is five consecutive <Signal signal="N" longVersion />s.
When this happens, the executor switches to "manual mode" and asks questions to figure out what state the cube is in.

## Results

We completed around 200 solves between the two of us, of which we tracked a little over 150.
We kept two timer sessions, one for each executor-oracle configuration.
As I write this just before the competition, we average around 1:15 with Joon as the oracle and around 1:30 with me as the oracle.
It's hard to tell how this stacks up against the competition or how well we'll perform in the two attempts we get, but we're pretty happy with our prep.

## Reflection

Preparing to participate in this event was a lot of fun!
Unlike official events or more popular unofficial events, this event probably had most teams actually designing their own methods.
We're excited to hear about what creative methods other teams came up with.
