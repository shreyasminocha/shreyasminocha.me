Unlike RGB and HEX, the HSL colour model is relatively easy for humans to wrap their heads around. Let's try to build that intuition!

HSL—**Hue**, **Saturation**, **Lightness**.

## Hue

**Hue** is a value from `0` to `360`. If that reminds you of circles and degrees, you're right!

The hues at 60 degree intervals are worth memorizing. Use a mnemonic, perhaps.

/>

> Red — Yellow — Green — Cyan — Blue — Magenta

The hues between these are graded gradually, as you'd expect.

## Saturation

**Saturation** is a percentage. It goes from "gray" (`0%`) to "dull" to "vivid" (`100%`).

> Vividness

<Figure

    alt="Saturation varying from `0%` to `100%` in `10%` increments"
    caption="Swatches of `hsl(0, x, 50%)` with `x` varying from `0%` to `100%` in `10%` increments"
/>

## Lightness

**Lightness** is also a percentage. It goes from "black" (`0%`) to "neutral" (`50%`) to "white" (`100%`).

> Brightness

<Figure
    src="/img/hsl-intuition/lightness-swatches.svg"
    alt="Lightness varying from `0%` to `100%` in `10%` increments"
    caption="Swatches of `hsl(0, 100%, x)` with `x` varying from `0%` to `100%` in `10%` increments"
/>

Keep in mind that the _neutral value_ of lightness is `50%`. Moving to the left or right takes you towards black and white respectively.

## Saturation vs Lightness

I sometimes find the distinction between **saturation** and **lightness** tricky.

Note how _low_, _medium_, and _high_ values of saturation and lightness combine:

<Figure
    src="/img/hsl-intuition/mini-saturation-lightness.svg"
    alt="Lightness and saturation taking the values of `25%`, `50%`, `75%` in a 3×3 matrix"
    caption="Swatches of `hsl(0, x, y)` with `x` and `y` varying from `25%` to `75%` in `25%` increments. `x` is on the y axis, `y` is on the x axis"
/>

Here's an expanded version of this matrix:

<Figure
    src="/img/hsl-intuition/saturation-lightness.svg"
    alt="Lightness and saturation varying from `0%` to `100%` in `10%` increments in a 11×11 matrix"
    caption="Swatches of `hsl(0, x, y)` with `x` and `y` varying from `0%` to `100%` in `10%` increments. `x` is on the y axis, `y` is on the x axis"
/>

## Grayscale

When saturation is at exactly `0`, the hue value becomes irrelevant and varying the lightness value gives you grayscale swatches!

<Figure
    src="/img/hsl-intuition/grayscale-swatches.svg"
    alt="Lightness varying from `0%` to `100%` in `10%` increments with saturation set to `0%` and hue set to anything"
    caption="Swatches of `hsl(*, 0%, x)` with `x` varying from `0%` to `100%` in `10%` increments"
/>

When lightness is set to `0%`, we get Black (`#000000`) regardless of hue and saturation. Similarly, when lightness is set to `100%`, we get White (`#ffffff`).

<Figure
    src="/img/hsl-intuition/black-and-white.svg"
    alt="Lightness `0%` is black, lightness `100%` is white"
    caption="Swatches of black and white"

Hopefully this has left you with a better intuition of how the HSL parameters affect the color they represent! Consider taking [a little quiz](https://guess-the-hsl.now.sh) I built earlier to test your grasp.
