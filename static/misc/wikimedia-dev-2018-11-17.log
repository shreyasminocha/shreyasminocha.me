09:13:09	<refeed>	Vijay_: Welcome
09:13:23	<Vijay_>	Thanks
09:15:31	<shreyasminocha>	hi Vijay_
09:16:57	<Vijay_>	hi @shreyasminocha
09:18:07	<shreyasminocha>	Vijay_: btw irc doesn't use @ for nicks
09:18:24	<shreyasminocha>	those are reserved for users with extra prvileges in a channel
09:18:24	<Vijay_>	oh k no probs :smile:
09:20:56	<takidelfin>	Vijay_: The task says: 'mIRC, webchat.freenode.net, AndroIRC are not okay.'
09:21:18	<takidelfin>	But you seem to use webchat.freenode.net :/
09:21:26	<takidelfin>	also, you need to register a nickname
09:21:31	<Vijay_>	my pc is crashed
09:21:37	<Vijay_>	so i couldnt download it
09:21:41	<takidelfin>	oh?
09:21:51	<takidelfin>	Have you tried to use HexChat?
09:22:06	<Vijay_>	nope
09:22:26	<shreyasminocha>	hexchat.github.io
09:22:32	<takidelfin>	also register your nickname: https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration
09:23:51	<Vijay_>	hi
09:24:07	<ProfTrench>	Good morning
09:24:39	<takidelfin>	Vijay_: And how is your HexChat installation?
09:24:52	<takidelfin>	Vijay_: because you are still using webchat
09:24:52	<Vijay_>	i didnt do it yet
09:25:12	<takidelfin>	Maybe we can help you fix the problems with it :D
09:25:38	<Vijay_>	its not installing
09:25:46	<Vijay_>	i cant install anything in my pc
09:26:32	<shreyasminocha>	:(
09:26:34	<shreyasminocha>	why?
09:26:35	<refeed>	Vijay_: Could you tell us what's the error? someone here might have a solution
09:26:41	<takidelfin>	yup
09:26:49	<takidelfin>	First tell us your OS
09:26:56	<Vijay_>	win10
09:27:00	<Vijay_>	need to reinstall it
09:27:13	<shreyasminocha>	what's so extreme that it warrants a reinstall?
09:27:15	<Vijay_>	the windows function are not working
09:28:23	<takidelfin>	`windows function` umm?
09:28:49	<Vijay_>	hey could u make this a good one
09:29:11	<shreyasminocha>	make what?
09:29:35	<Vijay_>	https://codepen.io/<redacted>/pen/<redacted>
09:29:43	<Vijay_>	this is my friend's pen
09:29:48	<Vijay_>	could u make it look good
09:30:43	<refeed>	Vijay_: I think if you can execute a browser in your OS, it's already good enough to execute hexchat program
09:31:16	<Vijay_>	could u make it look good
09:31:17	<Vijay_>	???
09:31:53	<shreyasminocha>	"make it look good" is very vague
09:32:09	<shreyasminocha>	we can give you suggestions as to make it look better, sure
09:32:16	<Vijay_>	could u edit it
09:32:23	<Vijay_>	by forking and give the link to pen
09:33:00	<shreyasminocha>	sorry, can't help you with that
09:33:08	<Vijay_>	anyone ?
09:33:50	<shreyasminocha>	Vijay_: why don't you try your hand at it?
09:34:01	<Vijay_>	i made some edits
09:34:07	<Vijay_>	which u are seeing right now
09:34:21	<Vijay_>	i am not much creative
09:34:25	<Vijay_>	thats why
09:35:33	<shreyasminocha>	1) maybe choose a different set of colours. deep blue with gold might look good. 2) use a different font face for the text, probably something that looks calligraphic for their name and a script fontface for the rest of the text.
09:36:00	<shreyasminocha>	3) the placeholder for the image (i assume) doesn't look very good with its purple inner border
09:36:21	<shreyasminocha>	and i'm not a fan of the rounded corners there either.
09:36:32	<Vijay_>	:+1:
09:37:38	<takidelfin>	umm
09:38:15	<Vijay_>	where to add the gold?
09:38:45	<shreyasminocha>	might look good as an accent colour. maybe some subtle lines where they make sense
09:38:52	<shreyasminocha>	or in some decorative swishes
09:39:03	<shreyasminocha>	try being creative, i'm sure you'll come up with something good
09:39:11	<shreyasminocha>	creativity is not innate
09:39:14	<Vijay_>	now check this
09:39:19	<Vijay_>	https://codepen.io/<redacted>/pen/<redacted>
09:40:24	<shreyasminocha>	how about this colour: https://www.colorhexa.com/0a296c
09:41:02	<Vijay_>	perfect
09:41:06	<Vijay_>	could u edit it
09:41:15	<shreyasminocha>	and maybe this font for things apart from the recipients name: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Great+Vibes
09:42:05	<shreyasminocha>	Vijay_: eh, it's customary to not ask people on the internet to do your work for you, but i'll do it this one time :)
09:42:17	<Vijay_>	thanks
09:42:22	<Vijay_>	make changes in alignment also
09:42:26	<Vijay_>	and thanks a lot
09:42:34	<Vijay_>	will not ask again :joy:
09:43:15	<shreyasminocha>	what alignment?
09:43:32	<Vijay_>	make it look like a certificate
09:43:37	<Vijay_>	thankskskskskksks
09:43:51	<Reedy>	shreyasminocha: You've obviously never heard of nerd sniping
09:44:01	<shreyasminocha>	Reedy: lol
09:44:08	<shreyasminocha>	i caught that xkcd ref
09:44:25	<shreyasminocha>	got*
09:44:29	<Reedy>	:)
09:44:58	<takidelfin>	Vijay_: I think you should remove the shadow from Title saying Certificate of Completion
09:45:07	<shreyasminocha>	i second that
09:45:14	<shreyasminocha>	in fact, i was going to mention it
09:48:04	<shreyasminocha>	Vijay_: i changed the colour and center-aligned the certificate id thing. take it from here. https://codepen.io/shreyasminocha/pen/VVzzzN
09:48:22	<shreyasminocha>	lmk once you've incorporated the changes into your version, after which i'll delete my fork
09:50:00	<shreyasminocha>	Vijay_: for the name, i think something like https://www.1001fonts.com/canterbury-font.html or another old english font would work well
09:50:09	<shreyasminocha>	but i think you should delete the underline underneath it
09:50:22	<shreyasminocha>	(unless you plan on printing the template, which i think is unlikely)
09:52:49	<Vijay_>	change what u think which are not perfect
09:52:50	<Vijay_>	pls
09:53:49	<shreyasminocha>	i really think you should do it yourself, there's a lot of value in learning by trying.
09:53:59	<Vijay_>	pls last time
09:54:15	<Vijay_>	my pc gets hanged when i open codepen
09:54:21	<shreyasminocha>	we've given the suggestions, if you're unsure about how to implement them you can of course ask us.
09:54:43	<shreyasminocha>	Vijay_: you could save them as html, css files and edit them on your system
09:55:03	<Vijay_>	last time edit pls
09:56:40	<shreyasminocha>	sorry man, i'm up to something else right now
09:57:02	<Vijay_>	pls just 10 mins
09:58:48	<takidelfin>	eh
09:58:58	<takidelfin>	You need to do tasks at your own too
10:01:11	<Vijay_>	not tasks
10:01:21	<Vijay_>	it is extra work
10:01:26	<Vijay_>	could u alter it
10:01:48	<Vijay_>	https://codepen.io/<redacted>/pen/<redacted>
10:06:06	<Vijay_>	?

[Vijay_ left at around 10:20]

10:22:55	<shreyasminocha>	phew
