# shreyasminocha.me

Source code for [my personal website](//shreyasminocha.me). Built using [hugo](//gohugo.io).

## Structure

- `archetypes`: files with standard frontmatter for each collection.
- `content`: blog posts, about page, other collections.
- `layout`
    - `_default`: templates that specify how content will be rendered to static pages.
    - `partials`: small re-usable portions portions meant to reduce duplication across layouts.
    - `shortcodes`: similar to `partials` but meant for reuse within content.
- `static`: static filesâ€”images, stylesheets, scripts, fonts etc
- `config.yml`: configuration

## Testing

### Running a server for development

```sh
hugo serve -p <port> --disableLiveReload --noHTTPCache --buildDrafts
```

I personally use [hotel](//github.com/typicode/hotel) for managing development servers, so after

```sh
hotel add --name shreyasminocha 'hugo serve -p $PORT --disableLiveReload --noHTTPCache --buildDrafts'
```

...and some configuration, I can access my local dev server at `shreyasminocha.localhost`.

### Running linters

Install dev dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run tests with:

```sh
npm test # Currently just runs `gulp`
```

Or more specifically, assuming you have `gulp` installed globally, run it with:

```sh
gulp
```
